[My most recent 'mega-gram' piece](https://abouthalf.com/#January-20-2020) collages clouds and my Scottish Rite temple with a portrait painted from a Uniqlo advertisement.

The clouds are based upon overlapping circles, their radii based upon Fibonacci numbers. I like the mental record-skip feeling of conflicting styles of “realism” in the same image. In this picture-space, is the woman “real” in front of some strange billboard? Is the temple real and dreaming of a woman? Maybe the clouds are seeing shapes in one-another.
