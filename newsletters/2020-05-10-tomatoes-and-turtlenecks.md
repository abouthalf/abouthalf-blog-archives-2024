![Megagram for May 9th](https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/oZs0WTb3giZ46YUUQdHDjQ/4c896fbc-0d44-476a-1dc8-3549d763b600/width=1200,format=auto "Megagram for May 9th")

I published a new big grid to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/abouthalf/) and my [website](https://abouthalf.com/p/2020/05/09). I'm continuing to use Uniqlo ads as source material - but I'm trying to blend in some more snapshots and found images. In this particular case I made a little vector illustration of a tomato to use as a repeating motif.

When I was working on my last [block of 15 paintings](https://abouthalf.com/p/2020/04/05) I told a friend that I found something interesting in hiding parts of my drawing or painting with other elements. I started thinking of these as "denied portraits".

[Yesterday I made that idea explicit](https://abouthalf.com/p/2020/05/10).

![Denied portrait](https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/oZs0WTb3giZ46YUUQdHDjQ/a49fde3c-45c3-4def-ce92-abe51695f700/width=1200,format=auto "Denied portrait")

If you click through to the web version of this - you may find that you can click and drag the tomato around, but you can't remove it. This owes a bit (_just a little bit_) to [Rene Magritte](https://www.renemagritte.org) and [John Baldessari](http://www.baldessari.org/unique/bxktlcphx0s1svxiq5r76nyf80c8lk), but while you might be able to move Magritte's apples or Baldessari's dots around the canvas - you'll never know because the museum won't let you get that close to find out.
