I was out walking my dog, Jonah, in the neighborhood. We came to a corner and Jonah became _very_ interested in something. It was meat.

In the grass between the sidewalk and the curb lay a package of beef, still in cellophane. It was there the next day. And the following day. I took a snapshot.

[One and Three Chairs By Joseph Kosuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6981637)

In this piece Josef Kosuth compares and contrasts the thing and representations or references to the thing. In this context they become interchangeable. Think about how the _Mona Lisa_ really only exists (as far as you know) as pictures _of_ a painting. At this point the pictures are the painting. In the case of Josef's chair the picture _of_ the picture _of_ the chair has replaced the chair.

One thing that's interesting about painting digitally is that you can paint "on" anything. Import a photo and just paint on top of it. I thought that it would be fun to paint with real paint on a photo.

I returned to my photo of street meat. I arranged the photo three times to create a repeating pattern. I added a steak emoji for flavor. I printed this onto a 12" x 18" sheet of canvas then laminated this onto a stretched canvas.

I set up my paints and easel. Jonah joined me.

I take a lot of photographs of my cooking. I had several good reference photos, so I painted a New York Strip steak on top of the photo collage.

I like the tension between the all-too-real meat in a package on the grass, the silly steak emoji, and the ennobled painting of a steak.

While I painted Caroline kept me company, reading her medical journal. By the time I finished we both wanted steak.
