Not long ago, I posted this on the ‘grams:

I deleted all of my other posts and made my account private. I use Apple’s “screen time” feature to lock Instagram after 20 minutes of use.

A few weeks ago, two people very close to me had their Instagram accounts stolen. Instagram was, naturally, of no help at all. One friend even submitted a selfie to prove that it was his account. It was rejected. (My friend’s account is used to peddle BitCoin now. If you’re into crypto, you may want to ponder why crooks, liars, and thieves are so interested in it.)

So you add all of _that_ to the fact that anything you post on Instagram is just a vehicle for ad sales. Your friend shares a story about their kid’s birthday party and Instagram just slaps ads all around it. It’s just gross.

I asked myself why am I contributing to their add machine? For free!

If I were to decide to try to be sell my artwork more aggressively I might choose to spin up a business account, but I think it’s time to be done with Instagram otherwise.

Sharing photos is fun tho.

The last of our small crop of summer tomatoes

The center of St. Johns has freshly paved streets. For a while the streets were blocked and you could march out into the middle of the road with your phone like an idiot.

The local swimming hole is drained and ready to hibernate through the winter.

This child is not using the skate park correctly.

This athletic field with a protective cover over the fence was strikingly horizontal in the late summer sun.

I travelled to Pacific City, OR for work recently and I had enough free time for long walks in the morning. It was foggy both days. I could disappear into the fog like a ghost.

I’ve printed these at 2ʹ ✕ 3ʹ onto canvas for future paintings. I’m not quite sure what I’m going to do with them, but some ideas are brewing. I was inspired by Gerhard Richter’s [seascapes](https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/photo-paintings/seascapes-22) and the real actual ocean.

(Richter’s website is a throwback to the 90s and I love its tiny buttons and tiny text)
