“Quarterly” – 24ʺ ✕ 36ʺ – Acrylic, inkjet, and mixed media on canvas mounted on wood panel

Back in October of last year I spent a couple of days in Pacific City, OR for a work retreat. We spent a day in a conference room showing each other slide presentations about our hopes and dreams for the coming year. The conference room was in a hotel by the ocean. This was both a welcome break from the routine of post-pandemic video-calls and terribly tantalizing. The ocean is just _right there_. I can see it.

In the morning, before our team breakfast and all-day meeting, I made a point to get out of bed early enough to go walk on the beach. It was a foggy morning. On parts of my walk the horizon disappeared and could only see about 50 yards in front of me. After walking about a mile I lost sight of everything familiar and felt like I was walking on the moon. I snapped some photos of the grey coast that morning; one of these photos became the backdrop of this painting.

[I wrote previously](https://abouthalf.substack.com/p/unhappy-little-clouds) about my struggle with painting clouds in this painting. I was trying to imagine what it might look like to cut a hole through the fog and see the sky on the other side. I also wanted to play with taking two “cheesy” subjects, the ocean and a sunrise, and combining them in an interesting way that perhaps defied one’s expectations of a landscape or a “beach scene”.

The tangerine takes the place of the sun in a sunrise. It also is a stand-in for still-life painting as a genre. In traditional still life paintings the bright subject would often be placed on a dark, neutral background like a shelf against a wall or a draped cloth. Here that neutral background is a photograph of the ocean. I liked the incongruity.

When I started this painting I knew I wanted to revisit some earlier cloud “icons” I created for an earlier series of paintings and digital images shared to Instagram.

I lost the original Sketch file I created for cloud icons, so I had to start over. No problem, I remembered the recipe.

My cloud icon is created three circles, aligned to a horizontal line. The diameter of each circle is a fibonacci number. I measured these out using inches, so from smallest to largest, the circles are 2, 3, and 5 inches in diameter. The units aren’t important really. If you scale the shapes up or down, the relative sizes stay the same. The center of each circle is 3 inches (horizontally) from its neighbor. This creates a little bit of overlap, so when the shapes are all filled in (and a rectangle to flatten out the bottom) you get a nice gentle cloud shape.

I printed my cloud icon out, trimmed away the background and taped it to my painting to visualize where the iconic cartoon clouds should live.

Once I landed on a location I used my _shiny new compass_ and constructed my clouds. I created a reference baseline and added marks to align the centers of the circles. I lightly drew in the circles with the compass and then covered those lines with blue painter’s tape. With a hobby knife, I cut away the interior of the circles. I decided, pretty much arbitrarily, that these iconic clouds would have a ½” border. I decided to inset the shape with more circles to create the border - but I didn’t really think it through, leading to a [happy accident](https://media.giphy.com/media/Q8vZZ6kGS1VFm/giphy.gif) later.

I painted borders first, up against the tape barrier, allowing several coats to dry. I taped over the border and cut out a new smaller shape. My thinking was that I would paint the interior of the cloud over the border, leaving nice sharp lines all the way around.

I miscalculated though. By moving the border inside my shape, the ½” thick inset no longer connected nicely into clean, sharp points. Whoops. Note to self sketch the inner circles first, then _add_ to the _outside_. Better luck next time. Using my compass I created a sort of elliptical connection from the smallest circle to the largest.

Turns out I like this very much. It breaks up the rigid geometry of the icon and gives a small sense of motion or direction to the cloud. As if the wind is pushing on the left hand side and the cloud is piling up over the right.

As I was taping off and repeating my cloud icon below the tangerine, I slapped some post-it notes onto my painting. Since the original trip which inspired these photos was all about _work_ and _planning_ I wanted to bring those ideas into this painting. The location and the task were discordant to me. Who wants to think about work at the beach? After placing the post-its where I liked them, I penciled in their corners and created taped off silhouettes where they would eventually be recreated in paint. I think it’s very funny and interesting that a little lightly colored square of paper is identifiable to us as a _thing_. Not just a specific thing, a thing with a _brand name_ and a job to do.

I chose to make my painted post-its reference the sunrise and sky colors. For good measure, I sketched in another little cartoon cloud, as if the tangerine had an idea for a cloud, which was later executed by her team.
