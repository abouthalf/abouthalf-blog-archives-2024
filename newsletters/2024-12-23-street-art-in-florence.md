![Two posters by Ache77](https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/image/foramt=auto,quality=75/https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/oZs0WTb3giZ46YUUQdHDjQ/2be19d48-9587-4ec7-083b-b06abc5f6c00/public)

As we walked all over Florence, I kept seeing these _faces_ looking out at me. These posters were always placed for maximum impact, right at eye-to-eye level. I’d find these on a corner jutting out into the street, or at a bend in an alley-way, any spot which seemed to naturally frame the portrait.

The first poster I saw was this ¾ view portrait giving me side-eye.

![Woman in profile, by Ache77](https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/image/foramt=auto,quality=75/https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/oZs0WTb3giZ46YUUQdHDjQ/2c8c9525-c88d-480c-1e8b-79317324e800/public)

If you look carefully you can see that the whites of her eyes have been colored (white) to provide a tiny bit of contrast. The figure is a silhouette, cut from a large piece of paper. She blends into her surroundings, as if she’s about to disappear into a doorway.

The next image that stood out to me was this direct, frontal portrait:

![Ache77 with graffiti](https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/image/foramt=auto,quality=75/https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/oZs0WTb3giZ46YUUQdHDjQ/3904ed38-5653-46c5-c9b5-d23fd0137800/public)

Here, she’s crowning the top of some electrical junction box, slathered in stickers and graffiti. Her jaw and neckline disappear into the background, as if she’s lit up by a papparazzo’s flashbulb. Who is she? [Jane Birkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Birkin)? [Margot Robbie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie)? Or an artistic amalgam?

Here she is again, with a new friend:

Our new friend has a sort of signature: _Be_Onigiri_.

Here’s our new friend again with green highlights

This time in shocking pink. It looks like someone tried to take her home, but failed.

These faces were all over -- there was a lot of other great street art too, but these portraits really spoke to me. I think it’s the confrontational gaze; the strong [FAFO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FAFO) vibes.

After I returned home I kept thinking about these images. I wondered if I could find out more about them. First I did a reverse-image search for _Be_Onigiri_.

![Be_Onigiri reverse image search results ](https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/image/foramt=auto,quality=75/https://abouthalf.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/oZs0WTb3giZ46YUUQdHDjQ/33f01b31-6891-4057-240d-d9f40e9cf700/public)

I found that [Be_Onigiri is the Instagram handle](https://www.instagram.com/be_onigiri/) for an artist calling themselves “Brat Effimera” - which is a great name. Could be a band, a brand, or a superhero from outerspace.

The profile has link, no description, only encouragment to have a nice day and _be onigiri_ (I will try). How mysterious.

I searched for the other two portraits the same way, and discovered the stencil artist Ache77.

Internet searching brought up this [interesting short interview](https://firenzeurbanlifestyle.com/ache77-parlare-con-gli-occhi/) (in Italian) on [firenzeurbanlifestyle.com](https://firenzeurbanlifestyle.com/) - try your browser’s translation feature.
